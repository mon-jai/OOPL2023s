  - Apply the team information on form if you already make up a team.
  - Once you already make up a team with option 1, you can start to practice Git and Game-Framework.
    - Create the Github repository.
    - Create two new branch `game-framework-practice` and `master`, and add `ntut-xuan` to Collaborators.
    - Practice the game-framework with tutorial, and push the practice result to branch `game-framework-practice`.
    - If you already complete the practice, create a PR (Pull Request) let `game-framework-practice` merge to `master` branch, and set `ntut-xuan` to reviewer.
    - `ntut-xuan` will check the practice result on PR, approve it if the practice result is good, otherwise, will leave the message to describe why fail.
    - Once you have approved from `ntut-xuan`, you can merge the branch to `master` or close PR.
